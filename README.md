My dotfiles for configuring i3-gaps
===================================

# Usage

Basically, each files and folders in the repository is corresponding to the same item in your $HOME directory, except for .git of course. So create symlinks for each files and reload your environment if necessary.

Please note that the file .gitconfig contains the configuration for my user, with my name and my email address. So don't use it without modifying it ;)

# TODO

* Complete the README.md with a list of the dependencies required by this configuration
* Write an installation script to create the symlinks automatically
